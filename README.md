# Welcome to this repo!

## This is the repo for the Git free workshop taught by me and @vfonsecad

### Before the session

We added all the participants for this session to this repo.

Please make sure to accept the collaboration invite, then you are **ready to go** for the session!

### During the session

Please check out the [tasks list](https://github.com/vfonsecad/version_control_workshop/blob/main/tasks/tasks.md) and choose a task of your interest. We will be using these tasks during the session to teach you how to properly work on a feature and collaborate effectively with others using Git and Github.
