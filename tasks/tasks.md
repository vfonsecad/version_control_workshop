## Are you a more advanced user of python and/or latex?

- Create your own branches and go ahead and create other latex sections as separate files. Then add those sections in the report.tex file
- Create other python codes that renders other figures and add sections in the latex report to display those figures. The latex sections should be added as separate .tex files and referenced in the report.tex file.
