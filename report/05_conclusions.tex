In this workshop we aimed at presenting the basic tools on how to work with version control and an efficient and effective way to branch which corresponds to the structure of the project. 

We hope that this workshop was very helpful for the students interested in learning how to use Git.

We also hope that you can not only work with version control in your projects but also that you take care of organizing the folders and files inside your projects in an organized way. We know it's a bit hard but it is necessary to keep consistency and robustness of our projects. \\

\noindent\textit{Keep Gitting! \\ Cheers, \\ Marco and Valeria}
